    q: 'What’s up with the home page?',
    a: 'Our goal is to feature student design work. It’s important to remember our roots, stay humble, and to lift those under us in our community. Education is a pinnacle cornerstone of setting our creative community apart. If you’re a student and have a cool project that you’d like featured, fill out this contact form.',

    q: 'I’m a wedding photographer, does that not count as commercial work?',
    a: 'Not by the scope of our list. We value you and your skillset, but the list would be endless if we included wedding and event photographers. There are plenty of other great services such as The Knot for you to utilize.',

    q: 'Why do you require creative shops to have been around longer than a year? Isn’t that unfair to the little guys?',
    a: 'We understand the startup hustle more than anyone else, but we want to make sure that the studios on our list are here to stick around for a while. Trust is an earned thing, and a potential client wouldn’t trust us very much if we recommended them a studio that suddenly disappeared.',

    q: 'I represent a creative studio and I’d like to pay you money to sponsor our listing. Is that something you do?',
    a: 'That would set an unfair advantage and would go against the spirit of why we developed this platform.',

  {
    q: 'I had a terrible experience with one of the studios and I want to complain about them. What do I do?',
    a: 'We’re not here to put companies down. We recommend solving your differences with them directly using good ole’ communication and compassion.',

  {
    q: 'I had a GREAT experience with one of the shops on the list. Can I share my story?',
    a: "YES! Adding positive experiences and testimonials is on our road map, and the more data you can provide us the better. Please fill out this <a hrefLang='en-US' class='underline' href='/contact' target='_blank'>contact form</a> .",
