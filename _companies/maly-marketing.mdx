description: We work hard to produce our best work for each client. We’re proud of our
  work. Sometimes we don’t get it right on the first try. Things happen. When
  things go wrong, we own it. We take responsibility for our wins and our
  losses. We learn from mistakes, and we don’t repeat them. “Best work. No
  bullshit.” is not just a motto; it is our culture. It’s something that we work
  toward every day, for each client. It’s the end result of our values and our
  commitment to producing work that our clients can be proud of. Creative
  problem solving is our specialty. Because most of our clients aren’t dealing
  with massive budgets, we’ve found that it helps to look for solutions that are
  straightforward and inexpensive to implement. There’s no need to start talking
  about rebranding if a targeted direct-mail or digital campaign can solve the
  problem. Although, if we need to start from scratch with a new brand or a
  rebrand, we have plenty of experience there as well.

At Maly Marketing, there's nothing confusing about the way we work. Because the truth is, attracting potential customers and taking care of the ones you have doesn't have to be complicated. Or sneaky. Or flashy. So let's have a real conversation. Tell us what makes you and your business tick and we'll transform your passion into a campaign that's both attractive and honest. Kind of like you. Hey, a little flattery never hurts.
