description: We’re OBI Creative, and we move people to engage with businesses and brands in
  new, exciting ways. Founded by Mary Ann O’Brien in 2001 as a project for
  California-based Gateway Computers (you know, the tech company with the famous
  cow boxes), we’ve since grown into an internationally-recognized research,
  strategic communications and advertising agency with offices in Omaha, Des
  Moines and San Diego. Today, we boast a client roster of Fortune 500
  companies, start-ups and nonprofits from across the region and around the
  globe; an ever-growing collection of hardware—56 marketing and creative awards
  in 2016 alone as well as a Silver Stevie Award for Company of the Year in the
  Advertising, Marketing and PR category; and, most importantly, results for our
  clients. Like you.
