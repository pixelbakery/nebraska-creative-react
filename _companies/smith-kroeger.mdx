description: We care about relationships that are built on trust and understanding – the
  kind where we speak the same language and have the same goals. That’s what
  moves us to create powerful work, and what accelerates our clients’ success.
  Moving full speed ahead doesn’t mean passing by life’s pleasures. Our kitchen
  is a gathering place for fresh popcorn, the occasional bowl of homemade “10
  o’clock guac” and free Wednesday doughnuts or bagels. Clients and other guests
  join us for a drink from our fully stocked bar, complete with a rotating tap
  of cold beer. And on any given day, a furry friend might come around to greet
  you. Yes, life is good here at Smith Kroeger.
