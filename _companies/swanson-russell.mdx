description: "Swanson Russell is an integrated, full-service marketing communication
  agency, with a focus on six key industries: Outdoor Recreation, Green/Turf,
  Agribusiness, Health Care, Construction and Regional Brands. That’s what we
  do, and it’s all we do. Which means we know those industries – and the people
  who live them – like the back of our hand. More importantly, we know how to
  bring them together. As a full service agency, we specialize in Brand
  Strategy, Digital and Traditional Creative, Website and Mobile Development,
  Social Media Content and Management, Media Services, Database Marketing and
  Public Relations. We’ll use every tool in the box to solve a problem. It’s all
  about the message on the page. And whether that page is on Facebook, in a
  magazine or anywhere in between, our aim is always the same: connect brands
  with the people who live them."
