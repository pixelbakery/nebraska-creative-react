Hurrdat is a company built to help tell brand stories via any digital medium. Reach your customers or clients where, when, and how they are looking or listening. We were founded in Lincoln, Nebraska as a small team of two in 2010, offering social media services to brands and athletes. A decade of growth later we've grown to be a uniquely well-rounded marketing and advertising company with in-house media, sports, entertainment, and film divisions. Mergers and acquisitions over the years with B2 Interactive, Disconnected Media, Digital Hero Films, Victory Fighting Championship, and Hail Varsity has grown our team to about 50 with offices in Omaha, Salt Lake City, and Lincoln.
