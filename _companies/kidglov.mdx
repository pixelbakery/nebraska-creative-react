  for all of us. When we work together, courageously, there’s nothing we can’t
  accomplish. As a boutique advertising agency, collaboration is what we do.
  You’ll see it in action each day within our own culture and in all of our
  interactions with our clients. KidGlov is how we do it: we intentionally serve
  organizations and corporations with the utmost care and attention. Because of
  who we are, we like to work with others who are also affecting positive
  change. So, we say to you, let’s put our ideas, voices and initiatives
  together to make a difference. With smart insights, we can help bring your
  intentions to life with heart-and-thought-provoking creative that moves
  people. Like you, we are optimists. We too believe this beautiful world can be
  made even more beautiful."
