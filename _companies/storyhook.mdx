description: We started StoryHook because we believe in the power of stories, and because
  we are driven and convicted by our desire to create meaningful content. When
  we took a closer look at the way traditional marketing and advertising were
  done, we saw a process that was rigid and lacked meaning. It was about big
  proposals and lofty promises, but often overlooked the thing that brands
  needed most – storytelling. We knew stories needed to set the tone of our
  business – in the way we met with clients, built websites, shot video, wrote
  copy and interacted with brands. Our story started with discontent, but that’s
  not where we’re at now. We’ve seen courageous brands step up and own their
  story, embrace their weaknesses and better understand their strengths. This is
  the best part of our job – telling stories and making marketing meaningful.

Nobody likes to be sold to, but everyone loves a good story. We're pretty convinced that marketing and advertising doesn't have to be about trickery, deception or manipulation. We believe that if you boil down the oftentimes fluffy and hollow elements that define this industry, at the core is an honest and sincere story just waiting to be told.
