CueMotion officially opened it’s doors in 2010 in Lincoln Nebraska, where we filmed weddings to get our business going. Our goal was always to transition to commercial and documentary work. Over the years we’ve produced video for small and large non-profits, advertising agencies, large corporations, small local businesses, and even developed shows for network reality TV that have gone on to air on HGTV, Discovery, DIY, Outdoor Channel and more. Since the beginning, we have approached every project with a philosophy to learn, and improve with each and every project.

This may come across the wrong way but, we get around. We have filmed in Africa, New Zealand, Mongolia, and all over the United States from New York to San Francisco. Our clients include The University of Nebraska Lincoln, Union College, Union Bank, Dorsey Pictures, Maranatha, Lincoln Chamber of Commerce, a bunch of Ad Agencies, Edible Beats, Mission Yogurt, and at this point you’ve probably stopped caring… So here’s some recent works.
